4. Safety Tips
Title: Walk Smart, Stay Safe

Tip 1: Use Crosswalks
"Always cross at designated crosswalks or intersections. Don't jaywalk or cross between parked cars where drivers can't see you."

Tip 2: Make Eye Contact
"Before stepping into the road, make eye contact with drivers to ensure they see you. Never assume a driver will stop."

Tip 3: Avoid Distractions
"Put away your phone and remove headphones when crossing streets. Stay alert to your surroundings at all times."

Tip 4: Obey Signals
"Wait for the 'Walk' signal and check that traffic has stopped before crossing. Don't start crossing if the signal is flashing or counting down."

Tip 5: Be Visible
"Wear bright or reflective clothing at night. Carry a flashlight when walking in poorly lit areas."

Tip 6: Don't Rush
"Walking too fast near roads can be dangerous. Maintain a steady pace and be predictable to drivers."
